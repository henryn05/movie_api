## How Was This App Made?
This is a movie database built mainly on the MERN tech stack. This repository contains code for the backend; Mongoose and MongoDB were used to create and connect the individual movie objects to a database. Render was then used to host the backend API, and Netlify was used to host the full project with the back and front ends.

My role in this app's development was a fullstack developer as I developed both the front and backend of the app with no team. The app can be viewed via this link: https://myflix-hn05.netlify.app. To view more of the project, including its frontend, visit the [frontend repository](https://github.com/myFlix-client).
